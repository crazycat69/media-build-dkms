    DKMS preparation description

This file describes how to create a Debian (Ubuntu) media-build DKMS package.

You need a TGZ file containing the DKMS sources. This TGZ file can be created
with scripts from the dkms/???? branches on 
   https://github.com/jasmin-j/media_build

Please checkout the latest (highest number) of those branches and read the
README_dkms file there for the instructions.



Once you have the "media-build-<PACKAGE_VERSION>.dkms_src.tgz" file, copy it
to the root of this tree and execute
   ./prepare_dkms_src.sh <distribution> [variant] [--help]

This script will extract the TGZ file and update all the local DKMS scripts
in this tree for the new TGZ file version.
After that create the Debian or Ubuntu package with:

   # create a binary package
   fakeroot debian/rules binary

   # create the source package and sign it
   debuild -S

   # create the binary package (no signing)
   debuild -i -us -uc -b

You can use script
   ./create_all_ubuntu.sh
to prepare the Launchpad upload files for all supported Ubuntu version at once.
