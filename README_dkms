    DKMS preparation description

This file describes how to create a Debian (Ubuntu) media-build DKMS package.

You need a TGZ file containing the DKMS sources. This TGZ file can be created
with scripts from the dkms/???? branches on 
   https://github.com/jasmin-j/media_build

Please checkout the latest (highest number) of those branches and read the
README_dkms file there for the instructions.



Once you have the "media-build-<PACKAGE_VERSION>.dkms_src.tgz" file, copy it
to the root of this tree and execute
   prepare_dkms_src.sh

This script will extract the TGZ file and update all the local DKMS scripts
in this tree for the new TGZ file version.
After that use 




PACKAGE_VERSION is read from dkms_ver.conf, so you need to edit this file
prior to the tar file creation.

The created tar file can be now used together with the above mentioned Debian
DKMS tree or with a similar packager.



    DKMS Branch naming in linux-media

The mediatree/master-ddbridge branch is used as the integration branch for
improvements and bugfixes. It is constantly rebased to mediatree/master and
therefore the HASHes are rewritten.

With this approach it is not possible to make valid TAGs. On the other hand
keeping mediatree/master-ddbridge consistant is too much effort. So we need
stable branches as snapshots.

The snapshots branch names have to start with "dkms/" followed by a number
which gets incremented with each new snapshot and finaly the date of the
snapshot generation. The latter is required, because the commit dates are
not suffcient to know when the snapshot has been taken.

Examples:
   dkms/0001-19_Aug_2017
   dkms/0002-28_Aug_2017
   dkms/0003-29_Aug_2017

media-build uses the same branch naming. It may happen that media-build
requires an update due to improofments. In that case the number from
media-build might be higher than the one from linux-media. With the next
change at linux-media this will be egalized.
